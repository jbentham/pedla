This is the source code for the Iosoft PEDLA project, using the VisualGDB development environment,
and the Mongoose TCP/IP stack. It runs on the PEDLA v2 hardware, with an RP2040W WiFi module.

This project was created for monitoring the EDSAC 3000 valve (tube) computer, and as such
has some quite complex interaactions with the hardware. It is not recommended as a starting-point
for experimenting with logic analysis on the RP2040; the 'wicap' project is much simpler.
